<p align="center">A Real-Time Food Donation and Waste Management System</p>


## Overview
**ZeroBite** is a real-time web-based Food Redistribution and Waste Management System that bridges the gap between **restaurants, event organizers, and individual donors** with **NGOs and charitable organizations**.  
The platform aims to reduce food wastage by efficiently redistributing surplus food before it expires.

Through a simple and interactive interface, donors can post available food items along with details such as **quantity, location, and expiry time**, while NGOs can **view, request, and collect food donations** within their vicinity.  
The system integrates **Google Maps API** for live location tracking, helping NGOs find the quickest route to the donor‚Äôs location.

ZeroBite is built using a modern **full-stack architecture** ‚Äî the **React.js frontend** provides a responsive and user-friendly interface, while the **Django REST Framework** handles backend logic, authentication, and communication with the **MySQL database**.  
The system also includes an **Automatic Expiry Management Module** that removes expired donations to maintain food safety and reliability.

By combining **automation, geolocation, and real-time data updates**, ZeroBite creates a transparent and efficient digital ecosystem for food redistribution.  
It not only helps reduce food waste but also supports hunger relief efforts by ensuring that edible food reaches people in need on time.
